# Build + publish ONE region's OPEN HOUSE-NUMBER overlay as a PMTiles archive to the `address-overlays`
# GitHub release, merged into address-overlay-manifest.json. The app (VelaMapView) STREAMS it and renders
# the `number` field as a SymbolLayer of house numbers where OSM lacks `addr:housenumber` (new suburbs).
# Sibling of build-overlay-region.sh (which does building FOOTPRINTS); this does ADDRESS POINTS.

# Data: OpenAddresses (openaddresses.io) - address points aggregated from open/government sources, per-source
# licenses (open). The batch API resolves the source's CURRENT job (job ids rotate per data refresh), whose
# GeoJSONL output is one Point per line with a `number` (+ `street`, `unit`, `city`, `postcode`) property.
# Needs: gh (authenticated), tippecanoe, jq, curl, gzip. LICENSE note in the release body.

# Build + publish ONE region's OPEN BUILDING-FOOTPRINT overlay as a PMTiles archive to the
# `building-overlays` GitHub release, merged into building-overlay-manifest.json. The app
# (OverlayTileStore) downloads it and renders the footprints BENEATH the OSM building layer, filling gaps
# where OSM lacks buildings (suburbs the Microsoft-to-OSM import never reached). Sibling of
# build-routing-region.sh.
#
# TWO data sources (both Microsoft, both ODbL), picked by the SOURCE env var:
#   SOURCE=us-legacy (default) - a US STATE from Microsoft US Building Footprints, one .geojson.zip:
#     scripts/build-overlay-region.sh delaware "Delaware (state)" \
#       https://minedbuildings.z5.web.core.windows.net/legacy/usbuildings-v2/Delaware.geojson.zip \
#       "45.54,-124.85,49.00,-116.92"
#   SOURCE=ms-global LOCATION=<Name> [QKPREFIX=<prefix>] - a COUNTRY (or a sub-national CHUNK of one) from
#     Microsoft's Global ML Building Footprints (quadkey-partitioned GeoJSONL under global-buildings/, listed
#     in dataset-links.csv). The 3rd arg (URL) is ignored - pass "-"; LOCATION is the dataset's Location column
#     (spaces stripped, e.g. "Andorra"). QKPREFIX (optional) builds only the quadkeys whose key starts with it,
#     so a giant country is split into buildable/hostable pieces (the app picks the chunk covering the user):
#     SOURCE=ms-global LOCATION=Andorra scripts/build-overlay-region.sh andorra "Andorra" - "42.42,1.41,42.66,1.79"
#     SOURCE=ms-global LOCATION=India QKPREFIX=13 scripts/build-overlay-region.sh india-13 "India (part)" - "<bbox>"
#
# Needs: gh (authenticated), tippecanoe, jq, unzip, curl, gzip. LICENSE: Microsoft Building Footprints is
# ODbL - a DATA license orthogonal to the app's GPLv3 (same as the OSM tiles). Obligation met by the
# tippecanoe --attribution below (shown in-app) + this release publishing the derived tiles under ODbL.

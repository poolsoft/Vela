# lean (scripts/VelaObfShim.java: no multipolygon, route-relation, proximity or country-region
# passes); address + POI come from the poi-packs SQLite, and MapLibre draws the map, GTFS covers
# transit. VELA_OBF_SECTIONS / VELA_OBF_LEAN widen it. Routing-only lean is what fits a 16 GB CI
# runner for a US-state-sized extract (measured 2026-09-04); the full set does not. The asset is

# Not processInRam (it already defaults to false): MapCreator's disk-backed pipeline is what lets a
# region bake inside a small runner at all. The heap bound is for its indexes, not the region.
#
# HEAP (2026-08-16). MEASURED, and the honest summary is that a GitHub runner cannot do this at
# country scale:
#   luxembourg  (~30 MB pbf)  -> 39 MB obf   OK at 12g
#   delaware    (~30 MB pbf)  -> 20 MB obf   OK at 12g
#   czech-republic            -> OOM at 12g (~37 min in)
#   de-bayern   (810 MB pbf)  -> OOM at 12g (~37 min), and OOM AGAIN at 14g after THREE HOURS
# So the ceiling sits somewhere between a US state and an 810 MB extract, and splitting a country
# into sub-areas does NOT by itself get under it - Bayern IS a sub-area. Note the 14g run's three
# hours: a job that slows down and then dies is thrashing a nearly-full heap, so a long runtime
# here is a symptom of the failure, not progress toward success. SerialGC keeps G1's region
# bookkeeping and concurrent threads (hundreds of MB) out of the way, but with the heap this close
# to full its single-threaded full collections are likely most of that three hours - try
# ParallelGC before reading any timing from this path as the tool's true cost.
# Regions this size need a machine with more RAM than a 16 GB runner; JAVA_HEAP exists so a local
# bake can be handed the headroom. MEASURED on a 32 GB machine: bayern at -Xmx22g SUCCEEDS in
# 3h07m and produces a 694 MB obf, with the heap peaking around 18.4 GB before a full GC - which is
# why 14g never had a chance, and why no GC flag was ever going to save it. ParallelGC vs SerialGC
# did not change the outcome, only the time to reach it (50 min vs 3 h to the same OOM), so it is
# still the right collector here: a doomed region should fail fast.
# 12g, not 14g: a 16 GB runner OOM-kills the JVM itself above that, and the lean routing-only
# bake (see VelaObfShim.java) was MEASURED to complete a 345 MB US state at 12g.
# ROUTING-ONLY bakes index a PRE-FILTERED extract: MapCreator's memory ceiling is its first
# pass over every node in the file, and buildings, landuse and the rest of the map are most of
# those nodes. Keeping only highway ways (with their nodes, so barriers, signals and crossings
# come along), ferry and shuttle-train routes and turn-restriction relations cuts a US-state
# extract to roughly a third of its bytes and a quarter of its nodes in a few seconds (route
# relations ride along for the bicycle profile's signed-route preference), which is
# what brings the big rows under a 16 GB runner's heap (measured on a state bake 2026-09-11, see
# CLAUDE.md). A bake that asks for the address or POI sections needs the whole file and skips it.

/**
 * All Vela-GENERATED spoken/banner nav text for ONE language. Vela builds turn instructions itself
 * (from OSRM step geometry) rather than scraping them, so localizing navigation = translating this
 * small, bounded set of templates — NOT machine-translating prose. The road/dest NAME passed in is
 * DATA (already in the local language) and is never translated; each method decides the word ORDER
 * around it (which differs by language — "Turn left onto X" vs "Tournez à gauche sur X"), which is why
 * this is per-language templates, not per-word substitution.
 *
 * Resolved by [NavStringsRegistry] (set explicitly from the app locale, never `Locale.getDefault()`,
 * because these run off the main thread — the nav loop + the TTS worker). Part of the app localization
 * effort (see the `project_vela_i18n` memory note).

/**
 * Where to try a side street around the plate cameras on a route (issue #600).
 *
 * The reporter's own workaround, automated: for each cluster of cameras the leading route passes,
 * try a point a little way to either side of the road at the cluster and route THROUGH it. The
 * router's own snap does the graph work: a point that lands on the same road folds back into the
 * same route (the camera count does not drop, so the caller rejects it), a point that lands on a
 * parallel street is a real detour. Nothing here knows about roads; it only says where to ask.
 *
 * Bounded on purpose: at most [MAX_CLUSTERS] clusters, nearest first, and the caller sends at
 * most [MAX_REQUESTS] route requests for a trip, because each one is a full route request to a
 * fair-use community router plus Google.

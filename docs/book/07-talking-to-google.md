# 7. Talking to Google

## What you see

Ratings, opening hours, photos, reviews, the live arrival time, transit directions, Street View
and the search box's suggestions. None of it needs a Google account, a Google Play Services
install or an API key, and none of it passes through a Vela server, because there is no Vela
server. Your phone asks google.com the same questions the Maps website asks from a logged-out
desktop browser, and reads the answers itself. This is the NewPipe model, applied to maps.

Most of the time you see nothing of the machinery. You notice it in three situations:

- **A notice card on the map** (or, rarely, a dialog) saying something like "search is down, a
  fix is on the way". That came through the signed calibration channel described below, not an
  app update.
- **A map that looks flat for a second** on a cold start, every place drawn the same size, then
  settles into big and small pins. That is Google's early-session answer being replaced by the
  full one.
- **Settings > Privacy > "Use Vela without Google"**, which turns all of this off at once.

## Where the data comes from

- **Google's public web endpoints**, the ones `www.google.com/maps` itself calls: map search,
  the autocomplete behind the search box, directions, the photo and Street View services, and
  the place pages. This is not open data and it has no license Vela can point to; it is what
  Google serves an anonymous browser, read on your phone for you. The endpoint list with the
  exact paths is in [SPEC 3.1](../../SPEC.md#31-endpoints).
- **`calibration.json`** at the root of the Vela repository, with its detached signature
  `calibration.json.sig` beside it. The app fetches both from GitHub's raw file host at launch.
  This file holds everything about the scrape that Google can break: request templates,
  response field positions, the browser identity, word tables, tuning numbers, notices and,
  when needed, replacement parsing code.
- **Community services** (the FOSSGIS OSRM and Valhalla routers, Nominatim, Photon, Overpass,
  Transitous) are not Google and are not covered here except for one rule: they get a
  different, honest user agent. Routing is [chapter 5](05-routing.md), search is
  [chapter 6](06-search.md), transit is [chapter 9](09-transit.md).

## How it is decided

### Per user, no key

Each phone is its own anonymous browser session. There is no API key in any build variant
(a hard rule in [SPEC 12](../../SPEC.md#12-degoogled-constraints)), and no token is extracted
from a page: search and directions were calibrated on 2026-06-15 and turned out to need only
ordinary cookies.

The session is warmed once per process. `GoogleSession.ensure()` makes a single GET of
`sessionWarmUrl` (from the bundle, `https://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&gl=us` today), dressed as
a first navigation, and the cookies it collects ride on every request after it. The cookie jar
lives in memory only, so a process restart is a fresh session.

```
callTimeout         = 12 s    // one hung scrape cannot stall a fan-out
connectTimeout      = 15 s
readTimeout         = 20 s
maxRequestsPerHost  = 24      // the ambient fan-out goes in one round, not OkHttp's default 5
```

Because every phone asks from its own IP with its own cookies, there is nothing central for
Google to block. That diffusion is the whole defense; Vela does not try to disguise itself at
the TLS layer (see Limits).

### EU consent cookies

A fresh, cookieless session in the EU or EEA is bounced to Google's `consent.google.com`
interstitial before search can run. The in-memory cookie jar pre-seeds the two cookies that
interstitial checks for, on `www.google.com`, `google.com` and `consent.google.com`:

```
SOCS    = CAESHAgBEhIaAB   // "consent recorded"
CONSENT = YES+
```

A later `Set-Cookie` that tries to downgrade `CONSENT` to a value not starting with `YES` (a
`PENDING` value, for instance) is dropped. US sessions are unaffected.

### The browser identity it claims

There are two user agents in the app, and mixing them up is a bug.

**Google-facing requests** claim to be current desktop Chrome on Windows. The compiled
fallback, used only when the bundle does not carry one:

```
USER_AGENT = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/153.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
SEC_CH_UA  = "\"Chromium\";v=\"153\", \"Google Chrome\";v=\"153\", \"Not/A)Brand\";v=\"24\""
```

Code reads the live pair from `CalibrationStore.current()`, never from the constants.

A user agent alone is not enough. Real Chrome sends a cluster of headers alongside it, and a
Chrome UA with that cluster missing is a sharper inconsistency than an old version number. So
`BrowserHeaders` sends the whole set:

| Header | Document fetch (session warm-up) | Data request (search, directions, autocomplete) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `User-Agent` | calibrated UA | calibrated UA |
| `Accept` | `text/html,...` | `*/*` |
| `Accept-Language` | `en-US,en;q=0.9` | `en-US,en;q=0.9` |
| `Sec-CH-UA` | calibrated brand list | calibrated brand list |
| `Sec-CH-UA-Mobile` | `?0` | `?0` |
| `Sec-CH-UA-Platform` | `"Windows"` | `"Windows"` |
| `Sec-Fetch-Dest` / `-Mode` / `-Site` | `document` / `navigate` / `none` | `empty` / `cors` / `same-origin` |
| `Referer` | none, as on a real first visit | `https://www.google.com/maps/` |
| `Downlink` / `RTT` | not sent | `10` / `50` |

The last row exists because google.com's `Accept-CH` asks for exactly those two network hints
(checked 2026-09-22), and Chrome sends them, rounded, on every request after the first
document. A request that carries them looks like one that saw the page. The photo RPC's POST
adds `X-Same-Domain: 1`, which the `batchexecute` endpoint expects from a same-origin caller,
and Street View tile fetches present themselves as a cross-site image load.

**Why desktop.** A mobile string would match the phone's TLS stack and carrier IP better. But
mobile web Maps serves different markup and different endpoints, and every parser in the app
was calibrated against the desktop responses. Switching to a mobile UA is a recalibration of
every parser, not a header edit, and the `?0` and `"Windows"` hints would have to move with it.
The hidden WebViews need desktop for a blunter reason: with a mobile UA, Google deep-links the
page to `intent://` and there is nothing to read.

**Why it has to stay current.** Chrome ships a stable release about every four weeks, so a
compiled UA is stale next month by construction; the one Vela shipped sat at Chrome 124 (April
2024) well into 2026. Staleness is a correctness risk before it is a fingerprinting one: Google
serves different response shapes to different browser generations, so a two-year-old Chrome
can be reading a legacy code path that gets retired without warning, which from the app's side
looks exactly like ordinary calibration drift. The compiled value tracks Chrome's current
Windows stable major, and not the next one: for a week in September 2026 it named a Chrome that
had not shipped yet.

**Community services get the honest one.**

```
VELA_UA = "VelaMaps/0.4 (+https://github.com/PimpinPumpkin/Vela)"
```

OSRM, Valhalla, Nominatim, Photon, Overpass and Transitous are free infrastructure Vela depends
on, and their usage policies ask for a contactable identifier so they can reach an abusive
client instead of blanket-blocking. Before 2026-09-15 the router requests were sending them the
spoofed Chrome string. The calibration fetch from GitHub sends `VELA_UA` too.

### Keeping the user agent current without a release

The UA and its brand list are fields in `calibration.json` (`userAgent`, `secChUa`). Refreshing
them is the same procedure as any calibration fix: edit, bump `version`, re-sign, commit. The
next launch of every installed copy picks it up.

Two guards stop a bad push from breaking the scrape:

- **The two must agree.** `secChUa`'s major version has to match the UA's; a hint advertising a
  different Chrome than the UA string is worse than no hint. `BrowserHeadersTest` locks the
  compiled pair, so bumping one alone fails the build.
- **Both are sanitized on parse.** OkHttp throws on a control character in a header value, at
  request-build time, inside `runCatching` blocks that swallow the throw. One stray newline in
  a pushed UA would silently kill every scrape with no crash and no log. So
  `BrowserHeaders.sanitize` trims surrounding whitespace first (a trailing newline in
  hand-edited JSON is recovered, not rejected), then rejects anything blank, anything outside
  printable ASCII `0x20..0x7E`, and anything longer than `MAX_UA_LENGTH = 400`. A rejected value
  falls back to the compiled default, never to an empty header.

The same pushed value reaches the hidden WebViews (below), so the OkHttp client and the browser
engine present one identity.

### The signed calibration bundle

`CalibrationStore` starts from a cached bundle if one is on disk and still verifies, otherwise
from the compiled `Calibration.DEFAULT`, so the app always has a working configuration with no
network. Then, once per launch and without blocking anything, it fetches:

```
REMOTE_URL = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PimpinPumpkin/Vela/main/calibration.json
SIG_URL    = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PimpinPumpkin/Vela/main/calibration.json.sig
```

and adopts the remote bundle only if all three hold:

1. **The signature verifies.** ECDSA over P-256 with SHA-256 (`SHA256withECDSA`), against the
   public key pinned in the app (`PINNED_PUBLIC_KEY`, an SPKI key in base64). The private half
   never enters the repository; `scripts/sign-calibration.sh` signs with it and self-verifies
   before anyone commits. A bundle that does not verify is ignored and the last good one stands.
   The cache is re-verified on every start, so a file tampered on disk falls back to the
   compiled default for that launch.
2. **Every endpoint host is on the allowlist**, `ALLOWED_HOSTS = { www.google.com, google.com }`.
   Even a correctly signed bundle cannot point search, directions, reviews, photos or the
   session warm-up anywhere else.
3. **The version is newer** than the active one. `DEFAULT.version = 1` on purpose, so any real
   bundle wins; the live file is at `version = 20` as of this writing.

Parsing is lenient field by field: a missing or malformed field falls back to the compiled
value, and a bundle can override just the one thing that drifted.

What the bundle can carry, from least to most powerful:

- **Request and response shape.** Endpoint URLs, the search and directions `pb` templates, the
  photo proto, and the positional field paths the search parser (`paths`) and the directions
  parser (`directionsPaths`) read. Paths merge key by key over the compiled ones, so a moved
  field is a one-line edit.
- **The browser identity**, `userAgent` and `secChUa`, above.
- **Word tables.** The only part of the scrape that reads localized *text* to make a decision:
  open and closed status words per language (`statusOpenWords`, `statusClosedWords`), the
  transit-category gate and its exclusions (`transitCategoryWords`, `transitExcludeWords`), and
  the review scrape's words and CSS selectors (`reviewWords`, `reviewSelectors`). A word missing
  in some language, or a CSS class Google rotated, is a config edit rather than an app release.
  These tables were in the data class from day one but not read by the parser until 2026-07-19,
  which is why adding a bundle field is two steps: the class, and `CalibrationStore.parse()`.
- **Fleet defaults**: the default voice, speaker and speed, the map palette, the places source,
  and the classic route picker switch. A user's own setting always wins over these.
- **Tuning dials**, a flat name-to-number map read through `Calibration.tune(key, default)`. A
  missing key means the compiled default, so adding a dial is an edit, never a schema change. The
  code reads 17 dials; the bundle carries seven today:

  ```
  browseZoom           = 15.5
  browseZoomWide       = 14.5
  browseZoomFocus      = 16.5
  overlayCoverFrac     = 0.18
  ambientFanoutPermits = 4      // applied at the next process start
  ambientCapMin        = 45
  ambientCapMax        = 140
  ```

- **Notices**: `id`, `level`, `title`, `body` and an optional `url`. Level `urgent` is a modal
  dialog; `info`, `warn` and `error` are dismissable cards on the bare map. Dismissal is
  remembered per `id` on the phone.
- **Parsing code**, `transformsJs`, next.

### Remote parse logic, and its kill switch

A moved field is a path edit. A response whose *shape* changed needs new logic, and new logic
normally means an app release. The bundle can instead carry a small JavaScript file defining
either or both of two functions:

- `parseSearch(rawResponse)` returns the places as flat JSON, replacing the compiled search
  parser entirely.
- `transformPlaces(placesJson)` post-processes whatever the parser produced.

It runs in Rhino, locked down by `JsSandbox`:

```
initSafeStandardObjects     // no Packages, no reflection, no IO: the script sees one string
optimizationLevel = -1      // interpreted; ART cannot run Rhino's bytecode generator
MAX_RUN_MS        = 2_000   // wall-clock kill switch
instructionObserverThreshold = 10_000
```

The kill switch is Rhino's instruction observer, checked every 10,000 instructions against a
deadline. Past two seconds it throws an `Error` rather than an `Exception`, so the script cannot
catch its way past it. Without it, an accidental `while (true)` in a pushed script would hang
the search forever and, because the sandbox is serialized, every search after it.

**Compiled Kotlin is always the fallback.** No script, a missing function, a parse error, a
wrong return type, an empty result or the timeout all leave the compiled result in place. The
path was verified on a device on 2026-06-18 and then cleared; the live bundle carries no script
today.

### The hidden WebViews

Some things Google will only serve to a real browser engine. The same request from OkHttp gets
a degraded reply, and headers do not change that: the detection is on the TLS fingerprint and
behavior, which is exactly what Vela declines to fake. For these, Vela loads Google's own page
in a hidden Chromium WebView, anonymously, lets Google's JavaScript render it, and reads the
result back out over a JavaScript bridge.

| Fetcher | What a plain request gets | What the page gives | Timeout |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Photos | a Street-View-only stub from the gallery RPC | the full collage, by tab (Menu, Food and drink...) | `55_000` ms |
| Reviews | the old review endpoint is gone | review cards, text, dates, reviewer photos | `45_000` ms |
| Popular times | search with the `[84]` histogram stripped | the same search, histogram intact | `22_000` ms |
| Transit directions | silently downgraded to a driving reply | real itineraries | `20_000` ms |
| Stop departure board | a degraded place payload | the board, embedded in the place page | `20_000` ms |

A sixth, visible WebView is the full reviews page, which shows Google's own reviews pane
carved down in place. What each page is and how it is read is in
[SPEC 3.7](../../SPEC.md#37-hidden-webview-scrapes); the transit pair is in
[chapter 9](09-transit.md).

All five hidden ones share `HiddenWebView`, and the rules that matter here are:

- **They sleep between fetches.** A loaded Google page keeps its compositor and timers running
  forever, which measured as roughly 27 percent of the app's CPU during a plain map pan. Each
  fetch runs inside `session { }`, which resumes the view before and pauses it after.
- **They are reaped.** Idle for `reapIdleMs = 120_000` and the view is destroyed; under severe
  memory pressure it is destroyed at once. The next fetch builds a new one.
- **They are warmed after results land**, never before a search. Building two Chromium instances
  on the main thread ahead of a cold search once held results at 13 seconds against 4 warm.
- **They cannot wander.** Only http and https load, and a scrape that must stay on one page
  refuses other navigations.
- **They are sized.** A headless WebView is 0 by 0, and Google's virtualized lists render
  nothing into it. Photos use an offscreen `1200 x 3200` CSS-pixel viewport, reviews
  `1200 x 1000`, both multiplied by screen density so Google serves its desktop layout.

**The same identity, as far as an app can.** Every WebView calls `WebViewIdentity.apply`, which
sets the calibrated UA and, through androidx.webkit, user-agent metadata built from the same
`secChUa`: Chrome brands, mobile `?0`, platform Windows, x86, 64-bit, a matching full version.
This was measured on a Pixel 4a with a header echo on 2026-09-22. Before it, a WebView whose UA
string said Windows Chrome still sent its own hints, `"Android WebView";v="153"`,
`sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?1` and `sec-ch-ua-platform: "Android"`, contradicting the UA three ways.
After it, the hints matched on Vanadium 153.

**The header that cannot be removed.** Every request from an Android WebView carries
`X-Requested-With` set to the app's package name. Chromium started removing it in M112 under a
deprecation trial, then abandoned the removal; the androidx allow-list API meant to control it
is marked disabled in Chromium's own feature list, and WebView's tests assert the header is the
package name on every main-frame and sub-resource request, on Google's WebView and on Vanadium
alike. So the WebView-backed features (photos, reviews, popular times, transit directions, the
stop board and the reviews page) tell google.com `app.vela` by name. Search, directions,
autocomplete and the map's place fan-out go through OkHttp and do not. `WebViewIdentity` still
makes the allow-list call, gated, in case a WebView build ever honors it, and logs one
`VelaWeb identity:` line per view saying which switches took. Overriding the header on the
document load alone was considered and not done: the page's own script requests would still
carry it.

### The slim early-session answer

For roughly the first three seconds of a fresh session, Google's search answers with a stripped
place block: the rating is there, the review count is not. The same query a few seconds later
comes back complete. This was bisected live on 2026-07-14.

It matters because the map ranks and sizes Google's places by review count (see
[chapter 1](01-places.md#googles-own-ranking-when-google-is-drawing)). The fan-out that fills
the map on a cold start lands entirely inside that window, so the whole pool arrived with no
counts, every place scored zero, and dot sizes and label tiers went flat, then got cached that
way.

`nearbyPlaces` detects the slim flavor and asks again once:

```
rated >= 3                                     // enough rated places to judge
count(rated and no reviewCount) > rated / 2    // a majority, not all: the session can warm mid-burst
delay(1200)                                    // then refetch the whole fan-out once
```

If the refetch carries counts, its places go first in the merged pool, so the de-duplication
keeps the rich copy of each place. The heal doubles the request burst, but only on a cold
start. The map's stickiness rule never freezes a pool whose prominences are all zero, for the
same reason.

The fan-out it refetches is 15 category searches (8 on a low-memory phone or a constrained
link), at most `ambientFanoutPermits = 4` parsing at once. Each response is parsed into a
full JSON tree of up to tens of megabytes, and firing them all at once filled a Pixel 9's
512 MB heap in one burst. The permit count is clamped to 1..13 and is a tuning dial, so a dense area that
still spikes can be answered from the bundle.

### Language and region: the hl and gl rewrites

Every Google endpoint is written with `hl=en&gl=us`. Just before a request goes out, two
rewrites run:

- **`gl` (region)** becomes the country the phone is actually in: the cell network's country
  code, then the SIM's, then the locale's region, refreshed each launch. Any two-letter code is
  accepted; region tunes ranking, not the response shape. A US phone's request is byte for byte
  unchanged.
- **`hl` (language)** becomes the app's language, so categories, hours and the open or closed
  line come back in it. Only for languages the open/closed parser has a word table for; for any
  other, `hl` stays `en`, because an English status the parser can read beats a localized one
  it cannot, which would leave every place with no open or closed color. Chinese carries its
  script: `zh-TW` for Traditional (Hant script, or Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau), `zh-CN`
  otherwise. A caller can force a language outright (the tap lookup does, for a label in
  another script).

The hidden WebViews pin `hl=en&gl=us`, with one exception: the review page follows the app
language, because the page language decides *which* reviews Google serves, and reviews are
content, never translated for the reader.

### The autocomplete request

The search box's suggestions come from Google's own autocomplete, not the search endpoint. The
search endpoint ranks a partial address by prominence over the whole window and would answer a
house number with a ZIP code in another state; the autocomplete honors the location bias the
way the Maps website does. Once typing pauses for 320 ms, the app sends:

```
GET https://www.google.com/s?tbm=map&gs_ri=maps&suggest=p&authuser=0&hl=..&gl=..&pb=<window>&q=<text>&tch=1&ech=1
```

with the XHR header set above. The `pb` carries the viewport center and its height in meters:

```
SUGGEST_SPAN_M = 20_000     // when the caller has no viewport: about a town
span clamp     = 2_000 .. 500_000 m
```

When it answers, its rows are the suggestions (an exact hit from a downloaded address pack still
leads). When it fails, returns nothing, or Google is switched off, the older pipeline runs:
Photon, the on-device address index and, with Google on, the search endpoint. [Chapter 6](06-search.md) has the rest of search.

### What is dead, and not to be re-chased

Each of these was probed and proven closed. Re-probing them is a known waste of time.

- **The reviews RPC.** `listentitiesreviews` returns 404 for everyone, verified on 2026-07-19
  from a raw client and from a real logged-out Chromium. The endpoint and `reviewsPb` are still in
  the bundle, and `reviews()` still exists, but nothing calls it. All reviews come from the
  WebView scrape. If reviews break, debug the scrape, not the RPC.
- **Photo dates.** The gallery RPC (`hspqX`) is byte-identical to what the website sends
  (checked on 2026-07-11) and answers zero photos to anything automated, including a replay of
  the page's own request. It is bot-gated, not drifted, so a recalibration would change nothing.
  The app still fires it beside the photo walk, to join posted dates onto photos if it ever
  answers; today it does not, so the gallery shows no dates.
- **Popular times over plain HTTP.** The keyless search strips the `[84]` histogram, which for a
  while read as "login-gated". The WebView search gets the typical week. The live "busier than
  usual" bar is stripped from every anonymous request, and that one is login-gated.
- **Live traffic incidents.** Google draws them from proprietary binary vector tiles; Waze's feed
  sits behind reCAPTCHA (probed four ways on 2026-08-08, all 403). Only per-state DOT and 511
  feeds remain. Congestion coloring on the route covers "where is it slow".

### "Use Vela without Google"

One switch in Settings > Privacy (pref `google_free`, off by default), mirrored into the core
module's `NoGoogle` flag and checked at each seam where a Google request would start. With it
on:

- **Search** answers from Photon, OpenStreetMap's geocoder, with its own ranking softly biased
  to you, plus the downloaded place packs. Names and addresses, not categories, except where a
  region is downloaded. **Autocomplete** from Google returns nothing, so the Photon and
  on-device path runs.
- **Places on the map** come from Vela's own data. The Google fan-out, "More results", and the
  tap lookup that matches a tapped pin to its Google listing are all off.
- **Directions** are the open router's alone: no Google traffic, no Google alternates, no
  Google fallback route, so no live arrival time.
- **Every hidden WebView** returns nothing before it loads a page: no photos, reviews, popular
  times, transit directions or Google stop-board fallback. Their warm-ups do not run. The full
  reviews page is hidden.
- **Street View** answers "no coverage" and its button is hidden.
- **The traffic overlay** (a Google tile server) is off, and **satellite** stops falling back to
  Google's imagery for the close-up zooms.

What it does not touch: the calibration fetch (that is GitHub, not Google), the open basemap,
routing, transit boards from Transitous, cameras, road features and everything offline.

One Google request survives it, and only by choice: **a short Google Maps link**
(`maps.app.goo.gl/...`) says nothing about where it points until Google's link shortener is asked.
With "Open shared Google Maps links" on (the default, shown under the switch), `core/data/ShortLinks`
asks it once per hop with no cookies, reads the redirect's `Location` and stops before loading any
Google page; the target's place name and its own pin (`!3d`/`!4d`, preferred over the sharer's
`@` map center) are read on the phone by `MapLinkParser` and searched like any deep link. Turned
off, a short link is refused with a toast. A full `google.com/maps` link never needs the request.
A shared LIST cannot open under the switch at all, because its places exist only on Google's
servers (toast `map_import_needs_google`); with Google on it imports as before. Logcat `VelaLink`
prints where a short link pointed, cut before the `@` coordinates and the query. The FAQ's full cost list is in [docs/FAQ.md](../FAQ.md#can-i-use-vela-without-google-at-all);
what still works with no network at all is [chapter 8](08-offline.md).

## Limits

- **The TLS fingerprint is Android's, not Chrome's.** Matching Chrome's JA3/JA4 and HTTP/2 frame
  order would need a custom TLS stack, native dependencies, permanent maintenance, and would
  break reproducible F-Droid builds. Vela does not try. It is the reason the WebViews exist, and
  the reason the photo RPC and live popular times are closed.
- **Smaller residual tells, left alone:** Chrome sends `X-Client-Data` to Google origins and
  neither client here does; the WebViews and OkHttp keep separate cookie jars, so one phone is
  two sessions from one IP; `Accept-Language` stays `en-US,en;q=0.9` even when `hl` asks for
  another language.
- **`X-Requested-With: app.vela`** names the app on every WebView request, and no app can stop
  it. It is confined to the WebView-backed features; turning those off (or the whole switch)
  is the only way to avoid it.
- **The map's own Google tiles** (the traffic overlay and the satellite fallback) go through
  the map engine's HTTP stack, not `BrowserHeaders`, so they do not carry the Chrome identity.
- **The live bundle carries no `userAgent` today**, so every installed copy presents the UA
  compiled into its own build until one is pushed. An old build that never updates keeps an old
  Chrome unless the bundle carries a current one.
- **The major-version match is only enforced at build time.** A pushed bundle that updates
  `userAgent` without `secChUa` (or the reverse) is not cross-checked on the phone; the signing
  step is where that has to be caught.
- **A pushed UA reaches a WebView only when the view is built.** A view created before the
  launch's refresh keeps the old identity until it is reaped.
- **Adoption is one launch behind.** The bundle is fetched once per process, after start, so a
  fix reaches a phone on its next launch or the one after. `ambientFanoutPermits` in particular
  is read when the data source is built, so it needs a process restart.
- **There is no rollback, only roll-forward.** A bundle only replaces one with a lower version.
  Undoing a bad push means publishing the old content under a higher version number.
- **New parsing logic is limited to search.** `transformsJs` hooks the search parser only; a
  reshaped directions, autocomplete or WebView payload still needs a path edit or an app release.
- **The consent pre-seed is the lightest-touch fix.** If Google ever insists on its own consent
  handshake, the full form post is the follow-up, and nothing has asked for it yet.

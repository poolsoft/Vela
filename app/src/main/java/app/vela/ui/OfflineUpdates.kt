/**
 * When a downloaded region may update itself (user 2026-09-18).
 *
 * A rebaked region used to mean a fresh few-hundred-MB download, so updating was always a
 * deliberate act. Deltas change the economics (measured on Kentucky, a week of edits moved 1.3% of
 * the tiles and 3.2% of the bytes), but bytes are still bytes on a phone plan, so the choice stays
 * the user's, and the default is OFF
 * (see [mode]). On Wi-Fi or mobile, MapViewModel.scheduleAutoRegionPatches applies published
 * patches on its own once a day; the setting also decides whether the Update button may patch.
 *
 * [MOBILE] means "use cellular too" rather than "use everything": it still only ever applies a
 * DELTA unprompted. A full re-download is never automatic on any setting, because that is the
 * surprise this exists to prevent.
